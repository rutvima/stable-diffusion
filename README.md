# Stable Diffusion

In this two-week course you’ll master core image generation techniques and hands‑on model development. 
- **Week 1** introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and cross‑attention mechanisms, guiding you to train an image generator from scratch and produce high‑quality synthetic images.
- **Week 2** shifts to practical refinement, reviewing off‑the‑shelf diffusion models and applying fine‑tuning methods like DreamBooth and LoRA to personalize outputs using your own data.

By building end‑to‑end pipelines, you’ll acquire skills in model selection, training workflows, output evaluation and customization—empowering you to design, fine‑tune and deploy bespoke diffusion models that meet real‑world requirements and drive innovation in any creative or technical setting.
